This project Stock Market Data from Yahoo Finance is extracted and then cleaned and load into K-means Clustering Algorithm to detect similar companies based on their movements in the market. 

It mainly deals with developing a pipeline that normalizes the data and then runs the algorithm to produce the labels that assign the companies to different clusters, like Mcdonalds, Mastercard, Symantec, Apple, American Express, Sony, etc.
