In this project-based course on Microsoft Azure, we will be using a sample application in Visual Studio to create a CI/CD pipeline completely using the Microsoft Azure cloud development suite.

We will show direct deployment from local to Azure web apps, a simple CI process that builds our application on an agent and produces artifacts, and we will also create a CD process that adds on the deployment component to our CI pipeline. We will end up with a fully automated pipeline in Azure that is triggered on new code pushes to the Main branch.
