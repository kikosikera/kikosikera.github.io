summary: This is an intermediate project we will create clustering models in Azure Machine Learning Studio. We will understand how platform services in the cloud work and how machine learning algorithms function would be of great help in understanding better what we are executing in this guided project.

This is an intermediate project we will create clustering models in Azure Machine Learning Studio. We will understand how platform services in the cloud work and how machine learning algorithms function would be of great help in understanding better what we are executing in this guided project.

This guided project has the aim to demonstrate how we can create Machine Learning models by using the out-of-the-box solutions that Azure offers, by just using these services as-is, on your own data. The main focus is on the data and how this is being used by the services.
