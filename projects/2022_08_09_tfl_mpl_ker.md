In this study, a model has developed to detect unwanted potholes, using machine learning tools. A Kaggle dataset was curated in order to produce pothole detection using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks).


This project proposes a method where Tensorflow pre-trained model detects road damage in different situations. The experimental results demonstrate high accuracy although there are many obstacles on the road.
