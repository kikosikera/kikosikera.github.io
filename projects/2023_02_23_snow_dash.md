This project offers participants a deep grasp of Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform. It starts with fundamentals, emphasizing sourcing market intelligence data from Snowflake's Marketplace, providing diverse datasets for insightful, data-driven decisions. Participants learn to navigate and utilize the marketplace effectively, securing essential data access for analysis.

As the project progresses, participants build a virtual warehouse, set up a database, and organize data using Snowflake tables. They also acquire data loading expertise and gain proficiency in Snowflake SQL for data querying and manipulation. The project culminates in creating a Snowsight dashboard for visualizing insights, equipping participants with a solid foundation in Snowflake and data analytics for better decision-making.
