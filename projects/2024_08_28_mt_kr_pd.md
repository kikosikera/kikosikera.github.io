Colab Notebook and Python libraries are used in this project to explore dividend investing strategies for S&P 500 stocks. The project employs fundamental and technical analyses to identify undervalued and overvalued stocks.

Data Science and Machine Learning can enhance stock market analysis by using algorithms to identify high-yielding stocks. By screening the S&P 500 for companies with dividend yields above 6% and a solid five-year payout history, investors can find valuable opportunities.

A valuation model that incorporates key financial ratios, such as price-to-book and dividend yield, helps determine a stock's fair and intrinsic value. Focusing on stable sectors like utilities, financials, and energy enables investors to select companies with strong, consistent dividend records.
